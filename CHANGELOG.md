# Changelog

This is the changelog for the Cyface data collector.
It lists the changes between versions and highlights compatibility issues with the Cyface SDK for iOS and Android.
We follow the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) scheme and the guidelines from ["Keep a Changelog"](https://keepachangelog.com) as close as possible.

Since we did not run this changelog from the beginning early versions are not listed here.
Those version have never been published officially and thus changes to them are of no interest.
