        <h3><b>2. General information about the data processing</b></h3> \
        <h4><b>2.1 Purpose and scope of the personal data processing</b></h4> \
        <p>We process personal data of our users only to the extent necessary to provide a functional application and to provide our content and services. The processing of personal data of our users only takes place with the consent of the user. An exception applies to cases in which prior consent is not possible for actual reasons and only when the data processing is permitted by law.</p> \
        <h4><b>2.2 Legal basis for the processing of personal data</b></h4> \
        <p>Whenever we obtain the consent of the person affected for the processing of personal data, <a href="https://dsgvo-gesetz.de/art-6-dsgvo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a</a> EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis.</p> \
        <p><a href="https://dsgvo-gesetz.de/art-6-dsgvo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b</a> GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data that is required to fulfill a contract to which the data subject is a party. This also applies to processing procedures that are necessary for the execution of pre-contractual measures.</p> \
        <p>If the processing of personal data is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation to which our company is subject to, <a href="https://dsgvo-gesetz.de/art-6-dsgvo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c</a> GDPR serves as the legal basis.</p> \
        <p>In the event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person necessitate the processing of personal data, <a href="https://dsgvo-gesetz.de/art-6-dsgvo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Art. 6 para. 1 lit. d</a> GDPR serves as the legal basis.</p> \
        <p>If the processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and if the interests, fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh the first-mentioned interest, <a href="https://dsgvo-gesetz.de/art-6-dsgvo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f</a> GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing.</p> \
        <h4><b>2.3 Data deletion and storage duration</b></h4> \
        <p>The personal data of the data subject will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage no longer applies (for example if the associated project has been finished) or if the users account gets deleted. In addition, the data may be stored if the European or national legislator has provided for this in EU regulations, laws or other rules to which the person responsible is subject. The data will also be blocked or deleted if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned regulations expires, unless it is necessary to store the data further in order to conclude or fulfill a contract.</p> \
        <h3><b>3. Provision of the application and creation of log files</b></h3> \
        <h4><b>3.1 Description and scope of the data processing</b></h4> \
        <p>When the app is used, the following data is collected continuously:</p> \
        <ul> \
        <li>Geo coordinates (longitude, latitude and estimated accuracy)</li> \
        <li>3-axis acceleration data</li> \
        <li>3-axis angular acceleration data</li> \
        <li>3-axis magnetometer data</li> \
        <li>An anonymous identifier that allows you to recognize data from the same device</li> \
        <li>An anonymous user account that allows us to recognize that you are using a valid version of the App</li> \
        <li>The model of the smartphone used</li> \
        <li>The version of the operating system used on the smartphone</li> \
        </ul> \
        <p>This data comes directly from the sensors of the mobile device used or is generated in the mobile application. Continuous collection means that the geodata is collected at intervals of one second or more. Acceleration, angular acceleration and magnetometer data is recorded at the maximum frequency supported by the hardware.</p> \
        <p>The acquired data is shared with partners in the context for research and development projects. We will ensure, that there is a written agreement with those partners about shared responsibility. The legal basis for this shared responsibility is Art. 26 GDPR.</p> \
        <p>The data will also be stored partially or completely in the log files of our system. These data will not be stored together with other personal data of the user.<br>The legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files is <a href="https://dsgvo-gesetz.de/art-6-dsgvo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f</a> GDPR.</p> \
        <h4><b>3.2 Purpose of the data processing</b></h4> \
        <p>We use the recorded data in an aggregated and anonymized form for presentation in cartographic representations on our website. In addition, the aggregated and anonymized data is made available to our partner companies. The data offered in this way is used to create value-added services such as our own mobile applications or desktop applications or to carry out data analyses. The published data can be used to obtain road condition information and traffic information.</p> \
        <p>The log files are used to ensure the functionality of the application. The data is also used to optimise the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. An evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.</p> \
        <p>These purposes constitute our legitimate interest in data processing according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.</p> \
        <h4><b>3.3 Duration of storage</b></h4> \
        <p>The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose of their collection.</p> \
        <p>When the data is stored in log files, this is the case after no more than seven days. A storage going beyond this is possible. In this case the data of the user will be deleted or modified, so that an assignment of the client is no longer possible.</p> \
        <h4><b>3.4 Possibility of objection and removal</b></h4> \
        <p>The collection of the data and their storage in log files is mandatory for the operation of the application. Consequently, there is no possibility for the user to object.</p> \
        <h3><b>4. Registration</b></h3> \
        <p>In our application, we offer users the opportunity to register by providing personal data. The data is entered into an input mask and transmitted to us and where it is stored. The data will not be passed on to third parties. The following data is collected during the registration process:</p> \
        <ul> \
        <li>An e-mail address of the user</li> \
        <li>A password of the user</li> \
        </ul> \
        <p>During the registration process, the user&rsquo;s consent for the processing of this data is obtained.</p> \
        <p>If the user uses an invitation code, link or QR code, the user account will be linked to this invitation during registration. The user is informed about this during registration and has the option to register without an invitation.</p> \
        <h4><b>4.1 Legal basis for the data processing</b></h4> \
        <p>The legal basis for the processing of data is <a href="https://dsgvo-gesetz.de/art-6-dsgvo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a</a> GDPR if the user has given his consent.</p> \
        <p>If the registration serves the fulfillment of a contract to which the user is a party of or if it serves the implementation of pre-contractual measures, the additional legal basis for the processing of the data is <a href="https://dsgvo-gesetz.de/art-6-dsgvo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b</a> GDPR.</p> \
        <h4><b>4.2 Purpose of the data processing</b></h4> \
        <p>A registration of the user is necessary for the presentation of the data collected by the user himself as well as the deletion of this data in accordance with <a href="https://dsgvo-gesetz.de/art-17-dsgvo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Art. 17</a> GDPR.</p> \
        <p>A registration of the user is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract with the user or for the execution of pre-contractual measures.</p> \
        <h4><b>4.3 Duration of storage</b></h4> \
        <p>The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required to achieve the purpose for which it was collected.</p> \
        <p>This applies to the data collected during the registration process if the registration is cancelled or modified in our application.</p> \
        <p>This is the case for data collected during the registration process to fulfill a contract or to implement pre-contractual measures if the data is no longer required for the fulfillment of the contract. Even after the end of the contract, it may be necessary to store personal data of the contractual partner in order to fulfill contractual or legal obligations.</p> \
        <h4><b>4.4 Possibility of objection and removal</b></h4> \
        <p>As a user you have the possibility to cancel the registration at any time. You can change the data stored about you at any time.</p> \
        <p>To revoke the registration or to modify the data stored, please use the appropriate functions in the application or on our website. If these functions are not available, please contact the data protection officer directly.</p> \
